# About 

My name is Mengjie Xu. I obtained my PhD from the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management in April 2024 and will join Duke University as an Assistant Professor of Accounting.

My research focuses on how information system design shapes strategic interactions among market participants and the associated market outcomes.

Focusing on discovering welfare-improving information system designs and seeking ways to enhance existing ones when they fall short, I am dedicated to conducting research that has real-world relevance and can be of practical use in improving market dynamics. 

This blog is practically my live research notebook. I make everything publicly accessible with hopes of helping lowering data barriers in Accounting/Finance research, thereby improving welfare for the community. After all, academia is a knowledge production industry, where insights should come first, not data hurdles.
